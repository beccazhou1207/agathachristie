Inspector Maine paused and then went on.<br>

<br>"And that leaves-just what exactly? Here's the position early on the
morning of the 11th. Armstrong has 'disappeared' (drowned). That leaves us
three people. Lombard, Blore and Vera Claythorne. Lombard was shot. His
body was down by the sea-near Armstrong's. Vera Claythorne was found hanged in her own bedroom. Blore's body was on the terrace. His head was crushed in by a heavy marble clock that it seems reasonable to suppose fell on him from the window above." <br>

<br>"Vera Claythorne's. Now, Sir, let's take each of these cases separately.
First Philip Lombard. Let's say he pushed over that lump of marble onto
Blore-then he doped Vera Claythorne and strung her up. Lastly, he went down
to the seashore and shot himself."<br>

"Yes, sir, Vera Claythorne's."

<br>"I know what you're going to say, Sir. That it was Vera Claythorne. That
she shot Lombard, took the revolver back to the house, toppled the marble
block onto Blore and then-hanged herself."<br>

<br>"And that's quite all right-up to a point. There's a chair in her bedroom
and on the seat of it there are marks of seaweed same as on her shoes. Looks as though she stood on the chair, adjusted the rope round her neck and kicked away the chair."<br>

<br>"But that chair wasn't found kicked over. It was, like all the other
chairs, neatly put back against the wall. That was done after Vera
Claythorne's death-by some one else."<br>
<br>"That leaves us with Blore and if you tell me that after shooting Lombard
and inducing Vera Claythorne. to hang herself he then went out and pulled
down a whacking great block of marble on himself by tying a string to it
or something like that-well, I simply don't believe you. Men don't commit
suicide that way-and what's more Blore wasn't that kind of man. We knew
Blore-and he was not the man that you'd ever accuse of a desire for
abstract justice."

<br>Inspector Maine said:
"And therefore, Sir, there must have been some one else on the island. Some
one who tidied up when the whole business was over. But where was he all
the time-and where did he go to? The Sticklehaven people are absolutely
certain that no one could have left the island before the rescue boat got
there. But in that case-" He stopped.

<div class="ac">
<br>The A.C. said sharply:<br>
<br>"Whose window?"<br>
"But if so, who took away the revolver from him? For that revolver was
found up in the house just inside the door at the top of the stairs-
Wargrave's room."
<br>The A.C. said:<br>
"Any fingerprints on it?"<br>

"But, man alive, then-"<br>

<br>The Assistant Commissioner said:<br>
"In that case-"
<br>He sighed. He shook his head. He leant forward.
"But in that case," he said, "who killed them?"
